I hope this tutorial has shown you how one can quickly generate geometry for a design task. There are many improvement that could be made to refine and enhance the model further. You may want to check out the lighting tools and how one could animate it using Three.js. And think about how you would add further constraints such as minimum/maximum volumes or controlled areas that cannot be perturbed by the computer. How about non-symmetrical profiles and wings with leading edges and/or flaps? Or simply repeating these steps in the CAD program of your choice. For example, Autodesk Fusion360 has a Python API for generating geometry.

For generative design, the wing profiles would be used as to basis to form meshes that would simulate airflow over them as well as FEA to test the evaluate the strength of the wing under load. The results of which could then inform then next iteration of the wing profile.

Hopefully this demonstration has shown you that it is not too challenging to design and build methods that generate complex geometry. The real challenge is in deciding how you wish to represent your geometry and the parameters that you wish the computer to manipulate as this ultimately defines the design space it can explore.
