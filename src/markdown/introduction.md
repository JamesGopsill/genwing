Generative design requires engineers to generate parametric models of their design spaces. We then use generative design algorithms coupled with simulations and post-processing of results against an objective function to explore and define the optimal designs for a given intent. In this blog, we showcase how one can generate code to create a wing profile.

In this example, we will be using solely web technologies, namely Three.js to create the model and visualise it in a browser. The operations you will use to create the geometry are very similar to the operations in many other geometric tools (e.g. CAD). They all have Application Programming Interfaces (API) to enable you to script the generation of advanced geometry.

Ever wondered how Formula 1 design their complex profiles? Then this gives you a taster.
